# This is a small project which takes a small dataset and applies Linear Regression and Logistic Regression from scratch in Python without using any Library .
# Linear Regression : The code written is from scratch and uses Gradient Descent .This calculates the RMSE Score of the model .
#  Logistic Regresion : The code written is from scratch and uses sigmoid function .This calculates the Accuracy of the prediction.
# Logistic Regression using Newton Method
